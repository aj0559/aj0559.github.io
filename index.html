    <h1>Courage</h1>
    <p>
    The Question isn't who's going to let me; its who's going to stop me. Life is like playing chess    with god your moves are called choice and his moves are called challenges.Love is like playing      chess a boy always afraid of losing his queen. and a girl is risking everything just to protect     her king.
