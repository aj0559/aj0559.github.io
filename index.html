    <h1>Courage</h1>
    The Question isn't who's going to let me; its who's going to stop me. Life is like playing chess with god your moves are called choice and his moves are called challenges.Love is like playing chess a boy always afraid of losing his queen. and a girl is risking everything just to protect her king.
